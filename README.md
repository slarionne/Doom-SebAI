# Doom-AI

The Doom AI Reinnforcement Learning algorithm was trained using the VIZDOOM emulator environment. This environment is typically used to train AI bots that play DOOM using visual information (the screen buffer). 
It is primarily intended for research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular. See https://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/ for details. Doom-AI also uses OpenAI Gym: https://gym.openai.com/
PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and PPO Algorithm: https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs. These libraries along with a RTX 3080 graphics card allowed for optimal learning and data processing for 
Reinforcement Learning. The results were not uploaded.
